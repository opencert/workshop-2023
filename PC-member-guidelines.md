# REVIEW PROCESS GUIDELINES FOR PC MEMBERS

### 1. OBTAIN A GITHUB ACCOUNT
In order to be able to participate in the review process you will need a GitHub account.
If you have not got one yet, please go to https://github.com and sign up for an account.


### 2. ACCESS SUBMISSIONS
Submissions are posted on this repository (https://github.com/opencert/workshop-2023/) in form of issues.
Go to the repository web page and click on the tab "Issues" to access submissions
(page https://github.com/opencert/workshop-2023/issues).
Then click on "Submission n (...)" to access submission number n. Title, abstract and PDF file are the same
as the ones available on Easychair. On Easychair you can also find the submission metadata.
Please note that without a GitHub account you can see the repository (https://github.com/opencert/workshop-2023/)
including the issues (https://github.com/opencert/workshop-2023/issues), but you cannot post comments.


### 3. SELF-ASSIGN SUBMISSIONS TO REVIEW
Each PC member should self assign ONE submission to review by posting the following signed comment in the related issue
of the chosen submission:

     I will review this submission.
     Your-name Your-surname

Please make sure you include Your-name Your-surname, since your GitHub name might not make your identity explicit.

Only choose submissions labelled "available for self-assignment". Note that initially all submissions are labelled in this way.
We can have up to 9 reviewers per submission. Before self-assigning the submission, make sure that the submission has
not been already self-assigned by 9 PC members. In case it has already 9 reviewers self-assigned, please give priority
to other submissions with less than 9 reviewers.
Please note that issue labels do not change in real-time, they must be changed manually by the Program Co-chairs.
The deadline for self-assigning the review is

     Tuesday 26 September 2023 at 23:59 AoE.

If by the deadline you haven't self-assigned a submission yet or you have self-assigned a submission that had already
enough reviewers and there are still submissions with less than 9 reviewers, then the Program Co-chairs will choose the
submission to assign to you.
Once the assignments of all submissions are completed, they will be entered on EasyChair.


### 4. REVIEW PROCESS
The review process consists of the following three phases:

a) INTERACTIVE PHASE (from Wednesday 27 September to Monday 2 October 2023)
   You will be able to interact with the authors and you are expected to provide feedback to the authors throughout
   this review phase. You may put questions to the authors and ask for clarifications.
   Authors are expected to consider your comments, revise their submission and upload it in the issue by

     Wednesday 4 October 2023 at 16:00 AoE.

b) ASSESSMENT PHASE (from Wednesday 4 to Thursday 5 October 2023)
   You will need to evaluate the revised submission to assess whether the authors have revised the submission according
   the reviewers' comments. By Thursday 5 October 2023 you have to upload your review on Easychair.
   You should structure your review as follows:
   1. highlight the strengths and weaknesses of the initial submission;
   1. summarise the feedback provided to the authors during the interactive phase (you may cut and past from GitHub);
   1. evaluate whether and how the authors properly addressed the discussion with the reviewers in the revised version;
   1. provide further feedback to the authors aiming to improve the paper;
   1. provide an overall evaluation, including a justification for for score/recommendation, using the confidential part of the review form.

c) FINAL DISCUSSION (on Friday 6 October 2023)
   It will be carried out on EasyChair. The revised version may be rejected, accepted as it is, accepted with minor
   revision (neither major revision nor conditional acceptance are possible)
   The final discussion will close on Friday 6 October 2023 at 23:59 AoE.

SURVEY PAPERS to collect previously published studies on topics related to the workshop and analyse them
in the context of open communities.

CASE STUDY PAPERS to report on case studies, preferably in a real-world setting.
